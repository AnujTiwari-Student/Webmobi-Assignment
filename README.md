# Webmobi-Assignment

"I developed an interface using React Native, utilizing a range of libraries and tools to enhance functionality and user experience. The project includes:

React Native: Utilized for building the core structure and components of the interface.

Expo: Employed to streamline the development workflow, manage dependencies, and simplify the build process.

TypeScript: Used for static type-checking, ensuring code quality and reducing potential runtime errors.

React Native SVG: Implemented to render and manipulate scalable vector graphics within the application.

React Native Vector Icons: Incorporated to add customizable icons, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the interface.

React Native QR Code: Used to generate a QR code, which when scanned, redirects users to nexalink.co.

Each of these tools and libraries played a crucial role in developing a robust and user-friendly interface, with the QR code functionality providing a seamless link to external resources."
